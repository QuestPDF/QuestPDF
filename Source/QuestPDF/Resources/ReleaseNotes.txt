Version 2025.1.0
- Implemented a Lazy element that delays content creation to reduce memory usage and enhance garbage collection efficiency in large documents.
- Optimization: releasing native objects as early as possible to reduce peak memory usage,
- Various performance and memory optimizations,
- Increased maximum level of parallelism from 2 to 4.


Version 2025.1.1
- Fixed rarely broken text alignment caused by too aggressive cache optimization.


Version 2025.1.2
- Adjusted the behavior of Row.AutoItem to preserve its size when a Row element spans multiple pages.
- Improved Linux compatibility by including the necessary native dependencies (OpenSSL and libjpeg-turbo).
 

Version 2025.1.3
- Fixed a rare layout rendering bug in the Table element.
- Improved memory management for Shared Image API by adjusting GC Memory Pressure.
- Fixed a bug in the DocumentOperation.AddAttachment method that incorrectly detected the file's MIME type when it was not explicitly provided.
- Added a new Placeholders.WebpageUrl() method.


Version 2025.1.4
- Added support for creating empty containers that can be injected into the document, significantly enhancing component extensibility.
- Added new element: PreventPageBreak.
- Updated in-code links to documentation to reflect recent changes.
- Fixed: AspectRatio element rarely positioned its content incorrectly.
- Fixed: The Row element incorrectly calculated the size of AutoItem when it contained text representing page numbers
- Fixed: Paragraph spacing was not applied when a span contained only a newline.


Version 2025.1.5
- Fixed: EnsureSpace did not render its content in some cases.


Version 2025.1.6
- Likely fixed a memory leak related to layout calculation caching by adjusting how Skia objects are used,
- Optimized memory usage by disposing native objects as early as possible in many rare scenarios, such as when an exception is thrown during generation,
- Improved caching algorithm accuracy,
- Updated skia native dependency to version 134,
- Updated qpdf native dependency to version 11.10.1,
- Updated OpenSSL native dependency to version 3.4.1.
