This release adds experimental support for the PDF/A-1a and PDF/A-1b conformance standards.

Due to the significant complexity of these standards, this feature is marked as experimental and may not cover all edge cases.

Output compliance has been tested with Adobe Acrobat Pro Preflight and veraPDF.
