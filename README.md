## What you need is here

`Comprehensive Layout Engine` - A layout engine tailored for document generation, offering advanced paging and precise content control.

`Rich Toolkit` - Craft documents with intuitive, reusable components and over 50 layout elements for complex designs.

`High Performance` - Generate thousands of pages per second with minimal CPU and memory usage.

## Code-Focused Paradigm

Using C# to design PDF documents leverages powerful control structures like if-statements, for-loops, and methods, enabling dynamic and highly customizable content generation.

It promotes best practices such as modular design and reusability while seamlessly integrating with source control systems for collaboration and versioning.

```csharp
.Column(column =>
{
    if (Model.Comments != null)
        column.Item().Text(Model.Comments);

    foreach(var item in Model.Items)
       column.Item().Element(c => CreateItem(c, item);
});
```

```diff
void CreateItem(IContainer container, Item item)
{
    container
-       .Background(Colors.Grey.Lighten2)
+       .Background(item.Color)
        .Padding(10)
        .Text(item.Text);
}
```

<br />

## Multiplatform

The library supports all major operating systems, integrates seamlessly with leading IDEs as well as popular cloud platforms and technologies to ensure maximum flexibility.

- `Technologies`: modern dotnet, legacy .NET Framework, Docker
- `Operating systems`: Windows, Linux, MacOS
- `Cloud providers`: Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

        FilePath = "metadata.xml"
    })
    .Encrypt(new Encryption256Bit
    {
        OwnerPassword = "mypassword",
        AllowPrinting = true,
        AllowContentExtraction = false
    })
    .Save("final-document.pdf");
