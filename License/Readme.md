# What License Do You Need?

## General License Overview

Open-source projects are an important foundation for the software development ecosystem. Modern applications are depending more and more upon the work of enthusiast and experts. Open-source is not anymore just sharing knowledge and passion with everybody. Over last years, maintaining and developing those projects have became a highly responsible task.

We identify the importance of the QuestPDF library in your projects, and therefore want to make sure you can safely and confidently continue the development.
